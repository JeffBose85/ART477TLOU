                            <p>Infected bloaters are the most powerful and dangerous type of hostile creatures that a survivor must face in the
                            post-apocalyptic world. Bloaters are a type of infected human who have progressed even further into the <a id="cordyceps">Cordyceps</a> fungus infection.</p>

                            <p>Bloaters are characterized by their massive size, muscular physique, and heavily armored fungal growth covering
                            their body. They are also highly resistant to damage, making them one of the toughest enemies in the post-apocalyptic world. Bloaters
                            have several unique attacks, including hurling deadly spore bombs that can cause significant damage to its target.</p>
                            
                            <p>Bloaters are the final stage of the <a id="cordyceps">Cordyceps</a> infection and have undergone significant physical transformation.
                            They have completely lost their human form and are now more akin to a giant, armored monster. Bloaters are also
                            extremely aggressive and will attack the target without hesitation.</p>
                            
                            <p>Due to their high resistance to damage and deadly attacks, Bloaters are one of the most difficult enemies in the
                            <span class="game">game</span><span class="series">series</span> to defeat. The survivor must use a combination of careful planning, stealth, and powerful weapons to take them down.</p>
