                            <p>The Cordyceps fungus is a central plot element and the cause of the post-apocalyptic world's collapse. The fungus is based
                            on a real-world fungus of the same name, which affects insects in nature.</p>

                            <p>In the <span class="game">game</span><span class="series">show</span>'s world, the Cordyceps fungus has mutated
                                <span class="game">somewhere in South America,</span>
                                <span class="series">in Jakarta, Indonesia,</span> allowing it to infect humans and other mammals. The fungus is highly
                            contagious and spreads through airborne spores, which can infect individuals who inhale them.</p>
                            
                            <p>The Cordyceps fungus has several stages of infection, each with its unique characteristics and effects on the host. The
                            early stages of infection, such as the spore and <a id="runner">runner</a> stages, result in physical transformations, with the fungus taking
                            over the host's body and mind. The later stages, such as the <a id="clicker">clicker</a> and <a id="bloater">bloater</a> stages, result in even more severe physical
                            changes, rendering the host almost unrecognizable.</p>
                            
                            <p>Infected individuals in the <span class="game">game</span><span class="series">show</span>'s world are highly aggressive and will attack any uninfected humans they encounter. They
                            are also highly resistant to damage, making them difficult to kill.</p>
                            
                            <p>In the <span class="game">game</span><span class="series">show</span>'s narrative, the Cordyceps fungus has caused a complete collapse of society, with the remaining humans struggling
                            to survive in a world overrun by the infected. The fungus has also forced humanity to adopt new survival tactics, such as
                            scavenging for resources and living in fortified communities.</p>
