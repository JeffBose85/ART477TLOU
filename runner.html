                            <p>Infected runners are one of the many types of hostile creatures that a survivor must
                                face in the post-apocalyptic world. Runners are a type of infected human who have recently been exposed to the <a id="cordyceps">Cordyceps</a>
                                fungus that has taken over the world.</p>
                            
                            <p>Runners are characterized by their erratic movements and their tendency to attack on sight. They are fast and agile,
                                able to outrun and outmaneuver the target. However, runners are also relatively weak and can be taken down with a
                                few well-placed shots or melee attacks.</p>
                            
                            <p>Runners are the second stage of the <a id="cordyceps">Cordyceps</a> infection, after the initial spore stage. They are characterized by a
                                significant physical transformation that results in a distorted, zombie-like appearance. They are covered in fungal
                                growths and have developed sharp claws and teeth, which they use to attack their prey.</p>
                            
                            <p>Runners are highly aggressive and will attack anyone they encounter, including other infected and uninfected humans.
                                They are often found in groups, making them even more dangerous.</p>
                            
                            <p>The behavior and appearance of runners are distinct from other infected types, such as <a id="clicker">clickers</a> and <a id="bloater">bloaters</a>, which have
                                more advanced stages of the infection. Runners represent an early stage of the infection and are one of the most common
                                and persistent threats that the survivor must face throughout their time.</p>
