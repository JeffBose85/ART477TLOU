                            <p>The Fireflies are a revolutionary militia group in the <span class="game">video game</span><span class="series">HBO TV-Series</span> "The Last of Us". They
                            are fighting against the oppressive military government in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by a fungal pandemic.</p>

                            <p>The Fireflies are introduced early in the <span class="game">game</span><span class="series">show</span> when <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> and <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> encounter Marlene, the group's leader, in Boston.
                            Marlene tasks <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> with transporting <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a>, who is immune to the pandemic, to the capitol building outside the Boston QZ.</p>

                            <p>Throughout the <span class="game">game</span><span class="series">show</span>, the Fireflies are portrayed as a well-organized and determined group, willing to take extreme measures
                            to achieve their goals. However, they are also shown to be divided and disorganized at times, with some members questioning the group's tactics and leadership.</p>

                            <p>The Fireflies ultimately play a pivotal role in the <span class="game">game</span><span class="series">show</span>'s climax, with <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> and <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> discovering that the group's methods
                            may not be as noble as they first appeared. The player is left to question whether the Fireflies' cause is truly just, or if
                            their actions are driven by desperation and a desire for power.</p>

                            <p>Overall, the Fireflies are an important element of the <span class="game">game</span><span class="series">show</span>'s narrative, serving as a catalyst for the story's events and
                            adding depth and complexity to the <span class="game">game</span><span class="series">show</span>'s themes of survival and morality in a harsh, unforgiving world.</p>
