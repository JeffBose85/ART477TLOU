							<p><a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> and <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> are entering Jackson County, Wyoming. At the hydroelectric dam gate, they are stopped and questioned. However,
								one of the men recognizes <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> as his brother and lets them in.</p>
							<p><a id="tommymiller">Tommy</a> gives them a tour of the dam and shows them the turbines, which are successfully powered up, giving electricity to the
								town. But their conversation is interrupted by a siren, as the dam is under attack by raiders.</p>
							<p><a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> and <a id="tommymiller">Tommy</a> fight their way through the raiders to find Maria and <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a>. <a id="tommymiller">Tommy</a> sees how much <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> cares for <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> and
								realizes that he must take her to the <a id="fireflies">Fireflies</a>. <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a>, however, is not happy with <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a>'s decision to leave her, so she
								rides off alone on a horse.</p>
							<p><a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> and <a id="tommymiller">Tommy</a> chase after her and eventually catch up to her in a farmstead, where they have an argument. <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> expresses her
								fear of being with anyone else, and Joel doesn't trust himself to protect her. The argument is cut short as raiders enter the
								home, but they fight them off.</p>
							<p>In the end, <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> makes up his mind that he will continue to travel with <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> because of how much he cares for her.</p>

							<p>In this chapter, <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> and <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> continue their journey towards Wyoming and come across a couple in the woods who direct them to a nearby
							settlement. As they pass a hydroelectric dam, they are stopped by a patrol and taken to Jackson, a small town where <a id="tommymiller">Tommy</a>, lives. Tommy gives
							<a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> and <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> a tour of the town, eventually <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> and <a id="tommymiller">Tommy</a> go to talk while Maria continues to take <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> around.
							<a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> asks <a id="tommymiller">Tommy</a> to take <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> to the <a id="fireflies">Fireflies</a> out west. However, <a id="tommymiller">Tommy</a> refuses, citing his desire to build a family with Maria.</p>
							<p><a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> opens up to him about his doubts about being able to protect <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a>, and he agrees to take her to the <a id="fireflies">Fireflies</a>. However, <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> is
							unhappy with the decision and argues with <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a>, bringing up the memory of <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a>'s daughter, <a id="sarahmiller">Sarah</a>. In the morning Tommy takes <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> to the stable where they find <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a>.
							<a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> had time to think about it and gives <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> the choice for either <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> or <a id="tommymiller">Tommy</a> to take her and <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> immediately chooses <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a>.</p>
