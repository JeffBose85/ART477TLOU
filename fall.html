						<h1><span class="game">TOMMY'S DAM</span><span class="series">JACKSON</span></h1>
						<span class="game">
							<p>Joel and Ellie are entering Jackson County, Wyoming. At the hydroelectric dam gate, they are stopped and questioned. However,
								one of the men recognizes Joel as his brother and lets them in, and they find Tommy.</p>
							<p>Tommy gives them a tour of the dam and shows them the turbines, which are successfully powered up, giving electricity to the
								town. But their conversation is interrupted by a siren, as the dam is under attack by raiders.</p>
							<p>Joel and Tommy fight their way through the raiders to find Maria and Ellie. Tommy sees how much Joel cares for Ellie and
								realizes that he must take her to the fireflies. Ellie, however, is not happy with Joel's decision to leave her, so she
								rides off alone on a horse.</p>
							<p>Joel and Tommy chase after her and eventually catch up to her in a farmstead, where they have an argument. Ellie expresses her
								fear of being with anyone else, and Joel doesn't trust himself to protect her. The argument is cut short as raiders enter the
								home, but they fight them off.</p>
							<p>In the end, Joel makes up his mind that he will continue to travel with Ellie because of how much he cares for her.</p>
						</span>
						<span class="series">
							<p>In this chapter, Joel and Ellie continue their journey towards Wyoming and come across a couple in the woods who direct them to a nearby
							settlement. As they pass a hydroelectric dam, they are stopped by a patrol and taken to Jackson, a small town where Joel's brother,
							Tommy, lives. Tommy gives Joel and Ellie a tour of the town, eventually Joel and Tommy go to talk while Maria continues to take Ellie around.
							Joel asks Tommy to take Ellie to the Fireflies out west. However, Tommy refuses, citing his desire to build a family with Maria.</p>
							<p>Joel opens up to Tommy about his doubts about being able to protect Ellie, and Tommy agrees to take her to the Fireflies. However, Ellie is
							unhappy with the decision and argues with Joel, bringing up the memory of Joel's daughter, Sarah. In the morning Tommy takes Ellie to the stable where they find Joel.
							Joel had time to think about it and gives Ellie the choice for either Joel or Tommy to take her and Ellie immediately chooses Joel.</p>

							monkeys from experiments and more evidence suggesting that the Fireflies have moved to Salt Lake City.</p>
						<p>
							As they try to leave, 
							<span class="game">they are ambushed by a group of looters and have to fight their way out. During the scuffle, Joel
