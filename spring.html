						reverse engineer a vaccine. <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> protests, but Marlene has him escorted out of the hospital.</p>

						<p>As <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> walks past his gear, he disarms a <a id="fireflies">Firefly</a> soldier and demands to know where the operating room is. He shoots the soldier
						and rampages through the hospital, killing anyone in his way, until he reaches the operating room. There, <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> is confronted by
						a doctor who refuses to let him take <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a>. In response, <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> shoots the doctor and escapes with <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a>.</p>

						<p>In the parking garage, Marlene tries to reason with <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a>, but he shoots and kills her before fleeing in a vehicle. When <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a>
						wakes up, <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> lies to her, saying that the <a id="fireflies">Fireflies</a> are no longer looking for a cure and that there are many people who are immune.</p>
