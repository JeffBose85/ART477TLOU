                            <p>Sarah Miller is a side character in the 
                                <span class="game">video game The Last of Us</span>
                                <span class="series">HBO TV-Series The Last of Us</span>
                            . She is the daughter of the <span class="game">game</span><span class="series">show</span>'s
                            main protagonist, <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a>, and is killed in the <span class="game">game</span><span class="series">show</span>'s opening scene during the initial outbreak of a fungal
                            pandemic that has decimated the world's population.</p>

                            <p>Sarah is a young teenage girl who is portrayed as being close to her father. She is shown to be caring,
                            sarcastic, and intelligent, with a strong sense of humor. She also has a rebellious streak, often sneaking
                            out of the house at night to go to parties.</p>

                            <p>At the start of the <span class="game">game</span><span class="series">show</span>, <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> and Sarah are in Texas and are forced to flee with <a id="tommymiller">Tommy</a> as the 
                            pandemic spreads. During their escape, Sarah is fatally
                            shot by a soldier and dies in <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a>'s arms. This event serves as a catalyst for <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a>'s character development
                            throughout the <span class="game">game</span><span class="series">show</span>, shaping his interactions with other characters and his outlook on life in the post-apocalyptic world.</p>
