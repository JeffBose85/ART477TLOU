								<span class="game">video game, The Last of Us Part 1, developed by Naughty Dog.</span>
								<span class="series">HBO Series, The Last of Us.</span>

								Joel is a smuggler who lives in a quarantine zone in Boston, Massachusetts, with his partner, Tess. </p>
							<p>Joel is initially presented as a cynical and emotionally closed-off survivor, having lost his daughter
								<a id="sarahmiller">Sarah</a> during the early stages of the outbreak. However, his life takes a dramatic turn when he is
								tasked with escorting a young girl named <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> across the country to a group known as the <a id="fireflies">Fireflies</a>,
								who believe that <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> may hold the key to creating a cure for the outbreak.</p>
							<p>As Joel and <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> journey across the country, Joel begins to develop a bond with <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a>, who becomes
								like a surrogate daughter to him. He begins to open up emotionally and comes to care for her deeply.
								Throughout the game, Joel is portrayed as a complex and morally ambiguous character, as he is forced
								to make difficult decisions and engage in violent confrontations in order to protect <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a>.</p>
							<p>Joel is depicted as a skilled fighter, with expertise in hand-to-hand combat and firearms. He is also
								resourceful and able to navigate dangerous environments with ease. He is shown to be a survivor at
								heart, who is willing to do whatever it takes to protect himself and those he cares about.</p>
