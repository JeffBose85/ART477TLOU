						<h1>HOMETOWN</h1>
						<p>
							The prologue takes place in Austin, Texas, in 2013 a fungal outbreak known as cordyceps has devastated the world.
							The outbreak originated in South America and mutated to infect humans, turning them into aggressive and deadly creatures.</p>
						<p>
							The prologue opens with Joel and his daughter, Sarah, celebrating her birthday at home. While watching TV, sarah falls asleep
							on the couch, eventually waking up in her own bed. She searches for joel and eventually finds him running from a runner. Joel
							kills the runner and Tommy arrives in his truck. The three attempt to leave town, but are caught in traffic and
							get into a car accident.</p>
						<p>
							They continue on foot, but encounter the infected creatures, known as runners. They manage to evade them and make it to the
							outskirts of town, where they are stopped by a U.S. soldier. The soldier is ordered to execute them by his superior, the soldier
							starts firing but is quickly shot by Tommy. But, it is too late Sarah is hit and dies in Joel's arms.</p>
						<p>
							This traumatic event sets the stage for the rest of the game, as it shapes Joel's character and motivation. He becomes a hardened
							survivor who is emotionally closed off and has lost faith in humanity. The events of the prologue also introduce the world of
							The Last of Us, showing the dangers of the infected and the harsh realities of the post-apocalyptic world.
