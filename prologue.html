							The prologue takes place in Austin, Texas, in <span class="game">2013</span><span class="series">2003</span> a fungal outbreak known as cordyceps has devastated the world.
							The outbreak originated in <span class="game">South America</span><span class="series">Jakarta, Indonesia</span> and mutated to infect humans, turning them into aggressive and deadly creatures.</p>
						<p>
							The prologue opens with Joel and his daughter, Sarah, 
							<span class="game">trying to celebrate his birthday at home. While watching TV, Sarah falls asleep
							on the couch, eventually waking up in her own bed. She searches for Joel and eventually finds him fleeing from a runner. Joel
							kills the runner and Tommy arrives in his truck.</span>
							<span class="series">
								eating breakfast before Joel leaves for work. Since it is Joel's birthday Sarah goes into town to repair Joel's watch as a gift.
								She returns home and eventually Joel aswell. Sarah eventually falls asleep while watching TV with Joel and is waken up by explosions
								and in her own bed. She looks for Joel to no avail and the neighbor's dog claws at the window. Sarah tries to return the dog when she 
								hears a crash from the neighbor's home and she investigates. She finds the families disabled mother infected and killing the others.
								Sarah runs out to the street where she is saved from Tommy and Joel as they pull up in a truck.
							</span>
							The three attempt to leave town, but are caught in traffic and
							eventually get into a car accident.</p>
						<p>
							They continue on foot, but encounter the infected creatures, known as runners. They manage to evade them and make it to the
							outskirts of town, where they are stopped by a U.S. soldier. The soldier is ordered to execute them by his superior, the soldier
							starts firing but is quickly shot by Tommy. But, it is too late Sarah is hit and dies in Joel's arms.</p>

							survivor who is emotionally closed off and has lost faith in humanity. The events of the prologue also introduce the world of
							The Last of Us, showing the dangers of the infected and the harsh realities of the post-apocalyptic world.
