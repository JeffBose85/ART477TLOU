						<h1>LAKESIDE RESORT</h1>
							<span class="series"><p>Ellie tries to treat Joel as he tells her to stop and leave him, and to go find Tommy. Ellie refuses and finds
								supplies to try and stitch Joel up.
							</p></span>
						<p>
							<span class="series">Eventually after helping Joel,</span> Ellie travels through the woods and Ellie goes hunting for herself and Joel. She finds a deer and follows it to an abandoned
							industrial facility, but is interrupted by two hunters, David and James, who offer to trade for the deer. 
							<span class="game">While waiting
								for James to bring back antibiotics, Ellie and David are attacked by infected and must fight their way out. 
								Eventually the infected are all killed and they create a fire to wait more.
							</span>
							<span class="series">While James goes back to get the medicine David and Ellie wait by a fire and talk.</span>

							David reveals that his group has encountered
							a crazy man and a little girl, which Ellie realizes is her and Joel. James comes back with a gun raised but David tells him
							to lower the gun and give Ellie the medicine.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ellie runs away with the medicine and is eventually tracked by David's group. She 
							<span class="game">evades them for a while but is eventually captured and</span>
							<span class="series">tries to flee on horseback but the horse is shot and she is captured and </span>
							taken to David's town, where she is locked up. David attempts to convince Ellie to join his group, but she refuses and
							is scheduled to be killed in the morning. However, Ellie reveals that she is infected and kills James before escaping.
							<span class="game">Ellie runs through the town while evading the searching group through a snowstorm. Eventually she gets into
								a restaurant-like building where David searches her down in.
							</span>
							<span class="series">Ellie escapes out of the room and goes out into the front of the building in a restaurant-like room. 
								David chases her down into the room</span>
							They have a fight and Ellie ultimately kills David.
						</p>
						<p>
							Joel wakes up and tries to find Ellie, knocking out some of David's men for information on her whereabouts. He eventually
							finds her in the restaurant and they both escape the town together.
