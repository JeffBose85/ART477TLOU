								supplies to try and stitch <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> up.
							</p></span>
						<p>
							<span class="series">Eventually after helping <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a>,</span> <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> travels through the woods and she goes hunting for herself and <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a>. She finds a deer and follows it to an abandoned
							industrial facility, but is interrupted by two hunters, David and James, who offer to trade for the deer. 
							<span class="game">While waiting
