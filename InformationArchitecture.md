# Overall picture
- The website will journey through each section of the game while including the TV series and how they differ.
- It will be split into the 5 different sections of game with subsections of different locations that are traveled.
- Hopefully there can be a button that 'switches views' from the game content to the TV series content.
- It would switch the information, pictures, and background.
- One each page I want to make the feel of almost a wiki page for the game and TV series, there will be links to various different characters and locations that will give information.
- The website will follow a linear progression having the user start in the Fall 2013 section and progressing all the way to Spring 2033, with various branch offs if the user wishes. But they are allowed to skip to any different sections at any time.

# Pages
## **Landing Page**
- Fade in the window picture of the real games 'Press any button to start'.
- Option 1: Get a gif that loops
- Option 2: Static picture if there is no gif that looks good
- Make the 'Press any button text' into a button that slowly fades in and out.
- Once the button is pressed the everything will fade and the user will be redirected to the home page. 
- *Maybe have the loading screen 'particle effect' for a short duration before redirecting

## **Home Page**
- A timeline will display showing the 5 main parts of the game, 'the prologue' and 4 different seasons the majority of the game goes through. 
- There will be a button that will switch between the game and tv series.
