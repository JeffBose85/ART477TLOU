# Overall picture ---
- The website will journey through each section of the game while including the TV series and how they differ.
- It will be split into the 5 different sections of game with subsections of different locations that are traveled.
- Hopefully there can be a button that 'switches views' from the game content to the TV series content.
- It would switch the information, pictures, and background.

# Pages ---
# Landing Page
- Fade in the window picture of the real games 'Press any button to start'.
- Option 1: Get a gif that loops
- Option 2: Static picture if there is no gif that looks good
- Make the 'Press any button text' into a button that slowly fades in and out.
- Once the button is pressed the everything will fade and the user will be redirected to the home page. 
- *Maybe have the loading screen 'particle effect' for a short duration before redirecting

# Home Page
- A timeline will display showing the 4 main parts of the game, the different seasons. 
- There will be a button that will switch between the game and tv series.
