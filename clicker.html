                            <p>Infected clickers are one of the most dangerous and feared types of hostile creatures that a survivor must face in the
                                post-apocalyptic world. Clickers are a type of infected human who have progressed further into the <a id="cordyceps">Cordyceps</a> fungus infection.</p>

                            <p>Clickers are characterized by their distinctive appearance, with a grotesque fungal growth covering their face and
                                head, rendering them blind. They navigate using echolocation, emitting a clicking sound to detect prey. Clickers
                                move slowly but are deadly in close quarters combat, as they can quickly overpower the target with their sharp claws and teeth.</p>
                            
                            <p>Clickers are the third stage of the <a id="cordyceps">Cordyceps</a> infection, after the initial spore stage and the <a id="runner">runner</a> stage. They
                                have undergone significant physical transformation, with the fungus completely taking over their body and mind.
                                Clickers emit a distinctive, high-pitched scream when they detect prey, which is a warning to the survivor to either
                                hide or prepare for a fight.</p>
                            
                            <p>Clickers are highly aggressive and will attack on sight. They are often found in groups, making them even more dangerous.
                                The survivor must use stealth and careful planning to avoid or take down clickers, as they are highly resistant to gunfire
                                and other forms of attack.</p>
