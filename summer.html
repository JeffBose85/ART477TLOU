								to the docks where Robert is hiding.</p>
							 <p>After finding Robert, they discover that he sold the weapons to the <a id="fireflies">Fireflies</a>. In a confrontation,
								 Tess shoots and kills Robert just as the leader of the <a id="fireflies">Fireflies</a>, Marlene, arrives on the scene.
								 Marlene offers to give them their guns back if they agree to smuggle a girl named <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> out of

						<h1>BILL'S TOWN</h1>
						<p><a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> and <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> are alone after Tess's death, and they head to a town occupied by only one person named Bill. The town
							is full of traps set by Bill, but they hope to obtain a car from him to find <a id="tommymiller">Tommy</a> more quickly. After
							entering the fence of the town, 
							<span class="game">they are met with many traps set by Bill, and while traveling through the town, <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a>
							steps in a trap and is caught by the foot and hung upside down.</span>

							<span class="series">They reach Bill's house but find it empty,
							prompting <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> to go search for him. Meanwhile, <a id="elliewilliams">Ellie</a> discovers a letter and a car key. As she reads the letter out loud,
							they learn that Bill has left all his belongings to <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> and advises him to protect Tess and other people worth protecting.

							<a id="joelmiller">Joel</a> locates the truck that Bill left him, and they both head to Bill's bunker to gather supplies, weapons, and clothing.
							With the truck, they leave the town to continue their journey to Wyoming to find <a id="tommymiller">Tommy</a>.</span></p>
						
						<span class="game"><p>They fight off the infected as they are rescued by Bill, and they lock themselves into one of Bill's many safehouses.

							should be a working battery in an abandoned FEDRA truck by the high school. As they close in on the school, they are
							ambushed and pushed into the school.</p>

						<p>They eventually find the truck but find that the battery is missing. As they continue to face the ambush of the infected,
							they eventually find themselves in the school gym where they encounter the first <a id="bloater">bloater</a> of the game. After killing the
							<a id="bloater">bloater</a>, they travel into a section of the neighborhood where they find Bill's partner Frank, who is dead. They eventually
							find a truck with the missing battery, but it is dead, so they must push-start the truck.</p>

							find <a id="tommymiller">Tommy</a>. The events of Bill's town are a testament to <a id="joelmiller">Joel</a>'s resourcefulness and resilience, despite facing many obstacles and ambushes.</p></span>
