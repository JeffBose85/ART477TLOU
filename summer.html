						<h1>QUARANTINE ZONE</h1>
						<span class="game">
							<p>20 years later, Joel and Tess are trying to find their weapons,
								which were stolen by a man named Robert. They must cross a checkpoint to get to him, but as they
								do, the Fireflies attack and they are forced to take an alternative route through a tunnel system
								to the docks where Robert is hiding.</p>
							 <p>After finding Robert, they discover that he sold the weapons to the Fireflies. In a confrontation,
								 Tess shoots and kills Robert just as the leader of the Fireflies, Marlene, arrives on the scene.
								 Marlene offers to give them their guns back if they agree to smuggle a girl named Ellie out of
								 the quarantine zone and to a group of Fireflies outside the city.</p>

								supplies and car battery were sold to the Fireflies, a rebel group that is fighting against the 
								government. As she tries to escape, a car bomb goes off outside and the wall of the room is blown in.
								Tess is then captured and held by the government's forces, FEDRA, for a few hours.</p>
							<p>Later, Joel and Tess reunite and try to get their car battery back from the Fireflies. However, when
								they reach the safehouse, they find that the Fireflies have been killed. They meet Marlene and Ellie,
								a young girl who they are tasked with smuggling out of the city in exchange for the car battery. </p>

						<h1>BILL'S TOWN</h1>
						<p>Joel and Ellie are alone after Tess's death, and they head to a town occupied by only one person named Bill. The town
							is full of traps set by Bill, but they hope to obtain a car from him to find Joel's brother Tommy more quickly. After
							entering the fence of the town, 
							<span class="game">they are met with many traps set by Bill, and while traveling through the town, Joel
							steps in a trap and is caught by the foot and hung upside down.</span>

							<span class="series">They reach Bill's house but find it empty,
							prompting Joel to go search for him. Meanwhile, Ellie discovers a letter and a car key. As she reads the letter out loud,
							they learn that Bill has left all his belongings to Joel and advises him to protect Tess and other people worth protecting.

							Joel locates the truck that Bill left him, and they both head to Bill's bunker to gather supplies, weapons, and clothing.
							With the truck, they leave the town to continue their journey to Wyoming to find Joel's brother, Tommy.</span></p>
						
						<span class="game"><p>They fight off the infected as they are rescued by Bill, and they lock themselves into one of Bill's many safehouses.
							After being met with hostility, Bill begrudgingly helps Joel, telling them that he doesn't have a working car but there
							should be a working battery in an abandoned FEDRA truck by the high school. As they close in on the school, they are
							ambushed and pushed into the school.</p>

						<p>They eventually find the truck but find that the battery is missing. As they continue to face the ambush of the infected,
							they eventually find themselves in the school gym where they encounter the first Bloater of the game. After killing the
							bloater, they travel into a section of the neighborhood where they find Bill's partner Frank, who is dead. They eventually
							find a truck with the missing battery, but it is dead, so they must push-start the truck.</p>

						<p>They are again ambushed by infected, but they eventually get the truck started and Joel and Ellie continue their journey to
							find Tommy. The events of Bill's town are a testament to Joel's resourcefulness and resilience, despite facing many obstacles and ambushes.</p></span>
